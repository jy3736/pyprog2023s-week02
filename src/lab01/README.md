# Hello STUST

## Objectives

The objective of this assignment is to write a simple Python program that outputs `"Hello, STUST!"`. 

## Requirements

- Write a Python script that contains a function named `main` which will be the entry point of the program.
- The main function is defined, which outputs the string "Hello, STUST!".

## Example Usage

```
$ python hello.py
Hello, STUST!
```

## Self-testing locally
It's recommended that you self-test your solution before submitting it. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```
python testing.py
```

This script runs the automated tests to verify if your solution is correct or not.

Alternatively, you can run the following command if you have the "make" tool installed:

```
make
```
