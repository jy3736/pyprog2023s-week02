# Hello STUST

## Objectives

The objective of this assignment is to write a simple Python program that outputs `"Hello, STUST!"`. 

## Requirements

- Write a Python script that contains a function named `main` which will be the entry point of the program.
- The main function is defined, which outputs the string "Hello, STUST!".

## Example Usage

```
$ python hello.py
Hello, STUST!
```

## Self-Testing with make
It's recommended that you self-test your solution before submitting it. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```
python testing.py
```

This script runs the automated tests to verify if your solution is correct or not.

Alternatively, you can run the following command if you have the "make" tool installed:

```
make
```

This will also run the automated tests to verify if your solution is correct or not. If you don't have the "make" tool installed, you can use the first command to test your solution.
